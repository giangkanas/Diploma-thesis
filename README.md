Abstract

Using the term of social influence, we refer to a phenomenon according to which, people change their behavior, to adjust to the requirements of their social environment. In parallel, social influence exists in many forms, not only in everyday real life but in virtual space of Internet and it has impact in many sectors like marketing, elections etc. Social networks are sets of users who interact and influence each other. To use this influence, in each sector, it is necessary to find which users are more influential than others. In this diploma thesis, the problem of predicting each node’s influence is considered as a classification problem and to deal with it we combine machine learning methods and node embeddings. Node embeddings are vectors, that can represent the users of a social network. In addition, for evaluating the influence of each user, we used SI epidemic model with a view to create simulations of spreading a rumor. We used six machine learning algorithms and four node embedding algorithms. The results, for three real world’s datasets, after combining machine learning and node embeddings, differs from method to method. Some of them are extraordinary and some of them aren’t that good.
