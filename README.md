In this diploma thesis, the problem of predicting each node’s influence is considered as a classification problem and to deal with it we combine machine learning methods and node embeddings. Node embeddings are vectors, that can represent the users of a social network. In addition, for evaluating the influence of each user, we used SI epidemic model with a view to create simulations of spreading a rumor.

We used six machine learning algorithms:
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes Model

2. Decision Tree

3. K-Nearest Neighbors

4. Logistic Regression

5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

6. Neural Network (We used Hyperband for finding good parameters for the network)


We used four node embedding algorithms:

1. Node2vec

2. DeepWalk

3. Walklets

4. Graph2vec


The results, for three real world’s datasets, after combining machine learning and node embeddings, differs from method to method. Some of them are extraordinary and some of them aren’t that good.
